# Calamares Configuration

This package is what makes RebornOS' Calamares behave differently from the upstream Calamares. This repository is also what enables Calamares to install RebornOS.

For a list of keys and options to configure check the equivalent modules in the core repository https://github.com/RebornOS-Developers/calamares-core
